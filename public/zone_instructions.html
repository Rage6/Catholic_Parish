      HOW TO KNOW THE CORRECT CEMETERY ZONE
    </h1>
    <p>
      QUESTION: How is the cemetery layed out?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: As of 2023, the cemetery is roughly split into two halves: the "old side" to the west and the "new side" to the east. The old side is divided into 8 rectangular areas that are labeled by letters. The new side is sliced into 11 horizontal rows. These rows are labeled as numbers, starting with the 1st Row in the south and ending with the 11th Row in the north. The rows are broken down furter into sub-sections, but those don't appear in the below map.

      QUESTION: How do I know which zone applies to a deceased member?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: The first column on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEJgPcC4c8M_owNmYirap50iclKg6PWf4ZV_7d3Yzzg/edit?usp=sharing">parish spreadsheet</a> provides the "section" of most of those buried at our cemetery. The labeling of sections have evolved over the years, but there are two basic rules that should help you:
      <ul>
        <li>
          IF THE SECTION IS ONLY A <u>LETTER (A - J)</u>: This means that the individual was buried in one of the 10 sections in the "old side", and you can simply select the letter that coincides with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          IF THE SECTION IS <u>ONLY A NUMBERS (1 - 62)</u>: This means that the individual was buried in a row in the "new side". There are 11 rows, with each row being composed of numbered sections. These numbers are what appear in the spreadsheet's section column sometimes. The below list can tell you which row a section number is within.
          <ul>
            <li>Row 1: Sections 51 - 55</li>
            <li>Row 2: Sections 46 - 50</li>
            <li>Row 3: Sections 41 - 45</li>
            <li>Row 4: Sections 36 - 40</li>
            <li>Row 5: Sections 31 - 35</li>
            <li>Row 6: Sections 24 - 30</li>
            <li>Row 7: Sections 15 - 23</li>
            <li>Row 8: Sections 7 - 14</li>
            <li>Row 9: Sections 1 - 6</li>
            <li>Row 10: Section 59</li>
            <li>Row 11: Sections 60 - 62</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          EXCEPTIONS: Unfortunately, there are several exceptions to these basic rules. For example, there are some sections that are labeled by double-letters or number-and-letters. There are even a few labels in the "new side" that use single letters, making them identical to those in the "old side". If you come upon one of these cases, simply skip it and leave them 'Unknown'. This is because they can only be solved if you were to get the actual hardcopy print-outs/binders of the cemetery, all of which are in the parish center. For that reason, I will solve those exceptions myself later.
