      HOW TO KNOW THE CORRECT CEMETERY ZONE
    </h1>
    <p>
      QUESTION: How is the cemetery layed out?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: As of 2023, the cemetery is roughly split into two halves: the "old section" to the west and the "new section" to the east. The old section is divided into 8 rectangular areas that are labeled by letters. The new section is sliced into 11 horizontal rows. These rows are labeled as numbers, starting with the 1st one to the south and ending with the 11th to the north.

      QUESTION: How do I know which zone applies to a deceased member?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEJgPcC4c8M_owNmYirap50iclKg6PWf4ZV_7d3Yzzg/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> provides the "section" of most of those buried at our cemetery. The meaning of sections have evolved over the years, but there are two basic rules that should help you:
      <ul>
        <li>
          IF A SECTION IS A <u>SINGLE LETTER</u>: This means that the individual was buried in one of the 10 zones in the "old section", and you can simply select the letter option that coincides with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          IF A SECTION IS <u>ONLY A NUMBERS</u>: This means that the individual was buried in a row in the "new section". There are 11 rows, with each row being composed of section. The below list can tell you which row that a section number applies to.
          <ul>
            <li>Row 1: 51 - 55</li>
            <li>Row 2: 46 - 50</li>
            <li>Row 3: 41 - 45</li>
            <li>Row 4: 36 - 40</li>
            <li>Row 5: 31 - 35</li>
            <li>Row 6: 24 - 30</li>
            <li>Row 7: 15 - 23</li>
            <li>Row 8: 7 - 14</li>
            <li>Row 9: 1 - 6</li>
            <li>Row 10: 59</li>
            <li>Row 11: 60 - 62*</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          ANYTHING ELSE: Unfortunately, there are several exceptions to these basic rules. For example, there are double-letter, number-and-letter, and even single letter sections in the "new section". Ignore these case because they require you to actually see the hardcopy blueprints of the cemetery to get the true answer. I will solve those myself.
        </li>
      </ul>
