      HOW TO KNOW THE CORRECT CEMETERY ZONE
    </h1>
    <p>
      QUESTION: How is the cemetery layed out?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: As of 2023, the cemetery is roughly split into two halves: the "old section" to the west and the "new section" to the east. The old section is divided into 8 rectangular areas that are labeled by letters. The new section is sliced into 11 horizontal rows. These rows are labeled as numbers, starting with the 1st one to the south and ending with the 11th to the north.

      QUESTION: How do I know which zone applies to a deceased member?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANSWER: Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEJgPcC4c8M_owNmYirap50iclKg6PWf4ZV_7d3Yzzg/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> provides the "section" of most of those buried at our cemetery. The meaning of sections have evolved over the years, but there are two basic rules that should help you:
      <ul>
        <li>
          IF THE SECTION IS A <u>SINGLE LETTER</u>: This means that the individual was buried in one of the 10 sections in the "old section", and you can simply select the letter that coincides with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          IF THE SECTION IS <u>ONLY A NUMBERS</u>: This means that the individual was buried in a row in the "new section". There are 11 rows, with each row being composed of numeric section. The below list can tell you which row that a section number is within.
          <ul>
            <li>Row 1: Sections 51 - 55</li>
            <li>Row 2: Sections 46 - 50</li>
            <li>Row 3: Sections 41 - 45</li>
            <li>Row 4: Sections 36 - 40</li>
            <li>Row 5: Sections 31 - 35</li>
            <li>Row 6: Sections 24 - 30</li>
            <li>Row 7: Sections 15 - 23</li>
            <li>Row 8: Sections 7 - 14</li>
            <li>Row 9: Sections 1 - 6</li>
            <li>Row 10: Section 59</li>
            <li>Row 11: Sections 60 - 62</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          EXCEPTIONS: Unfortunately, there are several exceptions to these basic rules. For example, there are sections labeled by double-letters, number-and-letters, and even single letters in the "new section". If you come upon one of these, simply skip it and leave them 'Unknown'. This is because they require you to see an actual hardcopy blueprint of the cemetery in order to get there true answer. I will solve those myself.
        </li>
      </ul>
