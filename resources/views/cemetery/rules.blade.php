      <div class="basicInfoList">
        <p>
          <u>Obey the Hours</u>: Our cemetery is open from dawn until dusk. Try not to remain in the cemetery after dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Speak Softly & Politely</u>: Remember to keep your voice down when having conversations, and avoid using bad language.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Drive with Care</u>: When starting to driving around the cemetery, turn to the right. Make sure to follow the roadway and remain off the grass. Drive slowly, and watch out for people who might not be paying attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Respect the Graves</u>: Don't touch any monuments or headstones; this is not only disrespectful, but may cause damage to the memorials, especially older ones. Never remove anything from a gravestone, such as flowers, coins, or tributes that have been left by family.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Look After Your Children</u>: If you bring children, make sure to keep a close eye on them and keep them from running, yelling, playing or climbing on graves and monuments. Teach them to act in a respectful and considerate manner.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          <u>Speak Softly & Politely</u>: Be respectful to other mourners: remember to keep your voice down when having conversations, and avoid using bad language.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          <u>Lower the Volume</u>: If you choose to bring it with you, take a moment to ensure that your cellphone is turned off. Avoid having phone conversations, as voices tend to carry in open spaces. Make sure to turn off your car stereo while driving or parking in the cemetery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Be Respectful of Services and Other Mourners</u>: If a funeral is occurring, take care not to get in the way of processions. Never take photos of strangers at a funeral or visiting a gravesite; it is extremely disrespectful to them in their time of grief. Respect their privacy and give them their space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Don't Leave Trash Behind</u>: Litter creates extra work for the caretakers, and is disrespectful to both other visitors and those who are buried there. Hang onto your trash and take it with you when you leave.
